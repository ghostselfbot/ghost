# Ghost <img width="150" align="right" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00fc815f-4cb3-4078-94bf-e16cf3fc9fea">
The most advanced open source Discord Selfbot.  
Ghost has 150+ commands and a completely custom built GUI for endless customisation!  

> [!WARNING]  
> Using Ghost <ins>can</ins> result in account termination! To avoid termination, do not use any commands in bigger servers especially ones moderated by Discord staff and do not use any of the abuse commands. I do not take any responsibility for the actions that may be caused by using Ghost. Please use with caution!
