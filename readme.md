# Ghost
The most advanced open source Discord Selfbot.  
Ghost has 150+ commands and a completely custom built GUI for endless customisation!  

> [!WARNING]  
> Using Ghost can and will result in account termination if not used carefully! To avoid termination do not use any commands within big servers especially ones moderated by Discord staff and do not use any of the abuse commands. I would also recommend using Ghost on phone verified accounts!
