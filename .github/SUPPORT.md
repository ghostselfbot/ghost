# Support
If you're experiencing an issue with Ghost, please first refer yourself to the discussions section and follow a guide or two. If you're still struggling the best way to reach us and gain support is by creating an issue on the GitHub page. Please try your best to resolve the problem yourself first before creating one.  
We also have a support Discord server where you can talk, share scripts and themes and gain support from the community!
